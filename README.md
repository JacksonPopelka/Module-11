# Module-11


This project involves scraping and analyzing data from two Mars-related websites. In the first part, a Python script uses Splinter and BeautifulSoup to visit a news site and extract the latest article titles and teaser text about Mars missions. The results are stored in a list of dictionaries for easy access and later use. The second part focuses on grabbing a Mars facts table from a public webpage, cleaning it with pandas, and exporting it as a CSV file. Both sections emphasize basic web scraping and data handling techniques that are useful for anyone working with real-world web data.
